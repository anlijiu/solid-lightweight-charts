You are an expert in TypeScript

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use unions, objects or maps instead.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.

Syntax and Formatting

- Prefer const arrow functions instead of function.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
